# Bash Cheat Sheet

 A cheat sheet for bash commands.

## Command History

```bash
!!            # Run the last command
```

## Navigating Directories

```bash
pwd                       # Print current directory path
ls                        # List directories
ls -a|--all               # List directories including hidden
ls -l                     # List directories in long form
ls -l -h|--human-readable # List directories in long form with human readable sizes
ls -t                     # List directories by modification time, newest first
stat foo.txt              # List size, created and modified timestamps for a file
stat foo                  # List size, created and modified timestamps for a directory
tree                      # List directory and file tree
tree -a                   # List directory and file tree including hidden
tree -d                   # List directory tree
cd foo                    # Go to foo sub-directory
cd                        # Go to home directory
cd ~                      # Go to home directory
cd -                      # Go to last directory
pushd foo                 # Go to foo sub-directory and add previous directory to stack
popd                      # Go back to directory in stack saved by `pushd`
```

## Creating Directories

```bash
mkdir foo                        # Create a directory
mkdir foo bar                    # Create multiple directories
mkdir -p|--parents foo/bar       # Create nested directory
mkdir -p|--parents {foo,bar}/baz # Create multiple nested directories

mktemp -d|--directory            # Create a temporary directory
```

## Moving Directories

```bash
cp -R|--recursive foo bar                               # Copy directory
mv foo bar                                              # Move directory
```

## Deleting Directories

```bash
rmdir foo                        # Delete empty directory
rm -r|--recursive foo            # Delete directory including contents
rm -r|--recursive -f|--force foo # Delete directory including contents, ignore nonexistent files and never prompt
```

## Creating Files

```bash
touch foo.txt          # Create file or update existing files modified timestamp
touch foo.txt bar.txt  # Create multiple files
touch {foo,bar}.txt    # Create multiple files
touch test{1..3}       # Create test1, test2 and test3 files
touch test{a..c}       # Create testa, testb and testc files

mktemp                 # Create a temporary file
```


## Moving Files

```bash
cp foo.txt bar.txt                                # Copy file
mv foo.txt bar.txt                                # Move file
```

## Deleting Files

```bash
rm foo.txt            # Delete file
rm -f|--force foo.txt # Delete file, ignore nonexistent files and never prompt
```

## Reading Files

```bash
cat foo.txt            # Print all contents
less foo.txt           # Print some contents at a time (g - go to top of file, SHIFT+g, go to bottom of file, /foo to search for 'foo')
head foo.txt           # Print top 10 lines of file
tail foo.txt           # Print bottom 10 lines of file
open foo.txt           # Open file in the default editor
wc foo.txt             # List number of lines words and characters in the file
```

## Finding Files

Find binary files for a command.

```bash
type wget                                  # Find the binary
which wget                                 # Find the binary
whereis wget                               # Find the binary, source, and manual page files
```

`locate` uses an index and is fast.

```bash
updatedb                                   # Update the index

locate foo.txt                             # Find a file
locate --ignore-case                       # Find a file and ignore case
locate f*.txt                              # Find a text file starting with 'f'
```

`find` doesn't use an index and is slow.

```bash
find /path -name foo.txt                   # Find a file
find /path -iname foo.txt                  # Find a file with case insensitive search
find /path -name "*.txt"                   # Find all text files
find /path -name foo.txt -delete           # Find a file and delete it
find /path -name "*.png" -exec pngquant {} # Find all .png files and execute pngquant on it
find /path -type f -name foo.txt           # Find a file
find /path -type d -name foo               # Find a directory
find /path -type l -name foo.txt           # Find a symbolic link
find /path -type f -mtime +30              # Find files that haven't been modified in 30 days
find /path -type f -mtime +30 -delete      # Delete files that haven't been modified in 30 days
```

## Find in Files

```bash
grep 'foo' /bar.txt                         # Search for 'foo' in file 'bar.txt'
grep 'foo' /bar -r|--recursive              # Search for 'foo' in directory 'bar'
grep 'foo' /bar -R|--dereference-recursive  # Search for 'foo' in directory 'bar' and follow symbolic links
grep 'foo' /bar -l|--files-with-matches     # Show only files that match
grep 'foo' /bar -L|--files-without-match    # Show only files that don't match
grep 'Foo' /bar -i|--ignore-case            # Case insensitive search
grep 'foo' /bar -x|--line-regexp            # Match the entire line
grep 'foo' /bar -C|--context 1              # Add N line of context above and below each search result
grep 'foo' /bar -v|--invert-match           # Show only lines that don't match
grep 'foo' /bar -c|--count                  # Count the number lines that match
grep 'foo' /bar -n|--line-number            # Add line numbers
grep 'foo' /bar --colour                    # Add colour to output
grep 'foo\|bar' /baz -R                     # Search for 'foo' or 'bar' in directory 'baz'
grep --extended-regexp|-E 'foo|bar' /baz -R # Use regular expressions
egrep 'foo|bar' /baz -R                     # Use regular expressions
```

### Replace in Files

```bash
sed 's/fox/bear/g' foo.txt               # Replace fox with bear in foo.txt and output to console
sed 's/fox/bear/gi' foo.txt              # Replace fox (case insensitive) with bear in foo.txt and output to console
sed 's/red fox/blue bear/g' foo.txt      # Replace red with blue and fox with bear in foo.txt and output to console
sed 's/fox/bear/g' foo.txt > bar.txt     # Replace fox with bear in foo.txt and save in bar.txt
sed 's/fox/bear/g' foo.txt -i|--in-place # Replace fox with bear and overwrite foo.txt
```


## Disk Usage

```bash
df                     # List disks, size, used and available space
df -h|--human-readable # List disks, size, used and available space in a human readable format

du                     # List current directory, subdirectories and file sizes
du /foo/bar            # List specified directory, subdirectories and file sizes
du -h|--human-readable # List current directory, subdirectories and file sizes in a human readable format
du -d|--max-depth      # List current directory, subdirectories and file sizes within the max depth
du -d 0                # List current directory size
```

## Memory Usage

```bash
free                   # Show memory usage
free -h|--human        # Show human readable memory usage
free -h|--human --si   # Show human readable memory usage in power of 1000 instead of 1024
free -s|--seconds 5    # Show memory usage and update continuously every five seconds
```


## Identifying Processes

```bash
top                    # List all processes interactively
htop                   # List all processes interactively
btm                    # uses bottom https://clementtsang.github.io/bottom
ps all                 # List all processes
```

## Bash Profile

- bash - `.bashrc`
- zsh - `.zshrc`

```bash
# Always run ls after cd
function cd {
  builtin cd "$@" && ls
}

# Prompt user before overwriting any files
alias cp='cp --interactive'
alias mv='mv --interactive'

# Always show disk usage in a human readable format
alias df='df -h'
alias du='du -h'
alias lsa="ls -lah"
```

## Run R Through the Shell

R scripts can be executed directly within the bash shell. Just like RStudio, the shell sends the code directly to your R executable.

However, similarly to setting up an IDE for the first time, you have to provide a path to a R executable. This can be bothersome. Therefore, it is handy to permanently save the path to R.exe as an environment variable. As a consequence, R routines can be invoked without passing the whole path every time anew.

Let´s define the path to the R executable as a new environmental variable:
 - Windows: Search for "Edit the system environment variables" --> Navigate to "Environment variables" at the bottom right corner --> In the "Environment variables" pane (lower pane), double click on "Path" --> Enter the path to the R executable as a new path (typically `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Programs\R\R-4.2.3\bin\`)
 - Mac:
 - Linux: None

Now you can access the R console through the command line simply by typing the command `R`. Similarly, the command `Rscript <file.R>` runs any entire R script.

Putting it all together: Using the shell, navigate to the folder containing the R script you intent to execute and pass `Rscript <file.R>`. Note that the bash working directory, i.e. `pwd`, does not filter through to R. Make sure that the working directory is defined in the R script.

More information on using R through bash can be found [here](https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/R-tricks#use-rscript-to-run-r-from-bash) repository.
